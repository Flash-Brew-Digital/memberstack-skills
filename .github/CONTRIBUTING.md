## Ways to Contribute

- **Fix inaccuracies**: Spot an outdated Memberstack API method or incorrect example? Submit a fix
- **Improve references**: Make existing Memberstack documentation clearer, more complete, or better structured
- **Add references**: Contribute new reference files for Memberstack APIs or topics not yet covered
- **Propose new skills**: Have an idea for a new Memberstack Agent Skill? Open an issue to discuss it
- **Report issues**: Found something broken or misleading? Let us know

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- Familiarity with Markdown and YAML frontmatter
- Understanding of Memberstack's ecosystem (Admin API, CLI, etc.)

### Setup

1. Fork the repository on GitHub

2. Clone your fork locally:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/memberstack-skills.git
   cd memberstack-skills
   ```

3. Review the repo structure:

   ```
   skills/<skill-name>/
   ├── SKILL.md                    # Entry point with frontmatter + overview + reference index
   ├── references/                 # Detailed reference docs
   ├── scripts/                    # Helper scripts for the skill
   ├── assets/                     # Static assets (CSS, images, etc.)
   └── .claude-plugin/plugin.json  # Plugin metadata (auto-synced from SKILL.md frontmatter)
   ```

## Skill Structure

Each skill lives in `skills/<skill-name>/` and is anchored by a `SKILL.md` file with YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
name: skill-name
description: One-line description used for discovery and matching.
license: MIT
metadata:
  author: "Author Name"
  version: "1.0.0"
---
```

The `SKILL.md` should include a quick start workflow, core patterns, and a reference index linking to all files in `references/`.

To scaffold a new skill:

```bash
node scripts/add-skill.js <skill-name> "<description>"
```

## Reference File Conventions

Every file in `references/` must have YAML frontmatter with three fields:

```yaml
---
name: "Human-Readable Title"
description: "One-line summary of the file's contents."
tags: [tag1, tag2, tag3]
---
```

### Content guidelines

- **Plain Markdown only** — no JSX components (`<Tabs>`, `<Steps>`, `<Note>`, `<Frame>`, etc.)
- Use fenced code blocks with language identifiers (e.g., ` ```typescript `)
- Use Markdown tables for structured data
- Use blockquotes (`>`) for callouts and notes
- Include a **Table of Contents** with a horizontal rule separator after it
- End each reference with a **Best Practices** section where applicable
- Keep references focused on one API domain or topic per file

### When adapting from external docs

Source documentation often uses JSX/HTML components. Convert these to plain Markdown:

| Source component | Convert to |
|---|---|
| `<Tabs>` / `<Tab>` | Separate sections with `###` headings |
| `<Note>` / `<Warning>` | Blockquote (`>`) |
| `<Steps>` / `<Step>` | Numbered list with `###` sub-headings |
| `<Accordion>` | Standard Markdown table or section |
| `<Frame>` / `<img>` | Remove (image URLs won't resolve in this context) |
| `<Button>` / `<a>` | Inline Markdown link |

## Development Workflow

1. Create a new branch for your changes:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feat/your-change-description
   ```

2. Make your changes following the conventions above

3. If you added or removed reference files, update the corresponding `SKILL.md` reference index

4. If you changed `SKILL.md` frontmatter, run:

   ```bash
   node scripts/sync-skills.js
   ```

5. Commit your changes and push to your fork

## Pull Request Process

### Before Submitting

- Reference files have valid YAML frontmatter (`name`, `description`, `tags`)
- `SKILL.md` reference index is up to date with any added/removed files
- Code examples are accurate and use correct Memberstack API methods
- Content follows the Markdown-only convention (no JSX/HTML components from source docs)

### PR Guidelines

1. **Clear title**: Describe what changed (e.g., "Update admin-api.md to match latest Memberstack API docs")
2. **Description**: Explain what changed and why
3. **Link issues**: Reference any related issues (e.g., "Fixes #123")

> Use common sense when drafting your pull request. The goal is to make it easy for maintainers to review and merge your changes. Include sufficient details but avoid unnecessary information.
