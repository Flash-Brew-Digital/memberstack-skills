  "description": "Work with the Memberstack Admin API to manage members, plans, and data tables. Use this skill whenever the user mentions Memberstack, member management via API, Memberstack data tables, or wants to build integrations that create/read/update/delete members or data records in Memberstack. Also trigger when the user asks about Memberstack API endpoints, authentication, pagination, querying records, or connecting plans to members — even if they don't say \"Memberstack\" explicitly but reference concepts like plan connections, member metadata, or admin member APIs that align with Memberstack's domain.",
